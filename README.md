# Chrome bug reproduction - PDF viewer doesn't send SameSite cookies in Range requests
MRE for Chrome bug [961617](https://crbug.com/961617)

To run, use `go run app.go` and visit http://localhost:8000/

The image and video display correctly (with both cookies being read) but for the PDF, range requests
don't include the SameSite=Lax cookie, which causes the proof-of-concept to return a 303. The PDF appears
to be loading forever and every page past the first is just blank.

Logs display the request URI path, the Range header and the Cookie header; in the logs below we can see that
the Range request doesn't include the Auth1 header which has been set with SameSite=Lax:

```
